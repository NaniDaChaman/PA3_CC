# This is a declarative approach to describe a Kubernetes based
# service and deployment for Apache Kafka

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kafka-svc
spec:
  type: NodePort   # say we deploy it as cluster service only (this is default)
  selector:
    app: kafka-broker  # used to match the pod(s) that run the actual kafka broker
  ports:
    - name: kafka-port    # not needed, but I have added this
      protocol: TCP     # this is default (so not needed either)
      targetPort: 9092   # port used by the running container inside the pod
      port: 30092   # the port advertised by the service to the cluster
      nodePort: 30092   # for outside world (we use same)
